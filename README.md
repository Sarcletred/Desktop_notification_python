The Notifier application is a simple yet effective tool for scheduling and managing notifications on your desktop. Built using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface, and Plyer for cross-platform notifications, it provides an intuitive way to set reminders and alerts.
One of the core features of the Notifier is its intuitive notification creation process. Users can input a title, a message, and specify a time delay in minutes before the notification appears. This simplicity allows users to quickly schedule reminders without navigating complex menus or options. Furthermore, the application supports visual customization options such as setting custom icons and adjusting timeout settings for notifications. These customization features not only personalize the user experience but also cater to different preferences in how notifications are presented.

Python serves as the foundational programming language for the Notifier project due to its versatility and extensive library support. Tkinter, a standard GUI library for Python, is employed to build the application's interface, providing familiar controls and layouts for users. Plyer, another crucial component, abstracts the complexities of platform-specific APIs, enabling seamless integration of notification functionalities across diverse operating systems. Additionally, the PIL (Pillow) library optionally facilitates image manipulation, allowing for the customization of notification icons to further enhance visual appeal and recognition.

The application's main window prominently displays fields for entering notification details, including title, message, and time. Upon setting a notification, the application waits for the specified time delay and then triggers a toast notification, which appears briefly on the user's desktop. Error handling mechanisms are incorporated to validate user inputs, ensuring that all required fields are filled and numeric values are correctly entered. This approach enhances user experience by minimizing potential errors and providing clear feedback during the notification scheduling process.
